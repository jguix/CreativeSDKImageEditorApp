# CreativeSDKImageEditorApp
This is the sample for the Image Editor component of the Creative SDK -formerly known as Aviary Editor or Feather Editor-, as explained in the official tutorial:

I just filled the gaps to create a complete app :)

To make it work you should complete the following tasks:

* Download the Creative SDK for Android: https://creativesdk.adobe.com/downloads.html
* Unzip and copy the directory named "creativesdk-repo" in the CreateSDKImageEditorApp folder
* Register an app in the Creative SDK site, and get your app Client ID and Client Secret: https://creativesdk.adobe.com/myapps.html
* Place Client ID and Client Secret in the resources file "res/values/keys.xml"
* You're ready to go :)
